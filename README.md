📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

I developed a stock price prediction model to forecast whether a stock's closing price will rise or fall 📉📈 and to predict the actual future closing prices. Key steps included:

🗂️ Data Collection and Preparation:

🌐 Imported historical stock data using the Quandl API.
📊 Visualized stock price trends and calculated features like "Open - Close" and "High - Low" to identify patterns.
🔍 Classification Model:

🤖 Implemented a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier to predict if the closing price would go up (+1 for Buy) 📈 or down (-1 for Sell) 📉.
🎯 Achieved an accuracy of 67% on the training data and 51% on the test data.
📉 Regression Model:

🧮 Used K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor to predict the actual future closing prices of the stock.
🔍 Fine-tuned the model using GridSearchCV to find the optimal number of neighbors.
📊 Generated predictions and compared them against actual stock prices for evaluation.
📊 Model Evaluation:

🔍 Created a comparative analysis between predicted and actual closing prices to assess model performance.
This project enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. 🚀📊📈
